                        We're built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. 
                        We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew the world's best coffee at home. 
                        It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel 
                        nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and opportunities in each of 
                        these places. We collaborate with exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community 
                        of farmers through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm 
                        community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we 
                        roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.
